## 📝 Project Overview

The **Todo List** is a clean, interactive web application designed for seamless task management. It's built with **Vanilla JavaScript** for all dynamic functionality and styled entirely using **Tailwind CSS** to achieve a modern, minimalist, and fully responsive user interface.

* **Focus:** Core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for daily task organization.

## 💡 Key Features & Logic

-   ✅ **Data Persistence:** All tasks are saved locally in the browser using **Local Storage**, preventing data loss upon refresh or closing the browser.
-   ✅ **Core Task Management:** Full ability to add new tasks, toggle status (completed/pending), and permanently delete individual items.
-   ✅ **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind's utility-first approach for perfect scaling across all screen sizes.
-   ✅ **Pure JavaScript Logic:** The entire application logic is implemented using Vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating strong foundational programming skills.
-   ✅ **Clean Codebase:** Clear separation between semantic HTML, compiled CSS, and application JavaScript logic.
